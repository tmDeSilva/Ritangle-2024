# Ritangle-2024
My solutions to the stage 3 Ritangle Crossnumbers. Each puzzle has a unique solution and requires you to submit the difference (D) between the down and across clues.

## Number Soup
* Uses OOP and has an average run time of 2 minutes
* It also uses another python file to generate all of the types of numbers used in the problem (such as four digit primes or lucas numbers)
* The original solution to this takes less than a tenth of a second (but is far harder to read)
  
### Solution:
Difference D: 11380

- 512873649
- 412768437
- 138599625
- 561324987

  
## Triangles
* The smallest and arguably the simplest Crossnumber
* Average run time is less than a tenth of a second

### Solution
Difference D: 84

- 776985
- 631862
- 562874
- 357675
  
## Genius 3
* I solved this manually but used pygame to allow me to simply click and insert answers to clues
* A python script was written to calculate the difference between the down and across clues

### Solution
Difference D: 4705
